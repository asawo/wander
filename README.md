# Wander

My first full stack project for dog lovers 🐕
Create an account to join the community and stare/like/pat the dogs! 👋🐶
You can also upload dog profiles yourself for everyone else to enjoy 👍
Deployed on [Heroku](https://wander-love.herokuapp.com/).

## Description

Wander is a service that will let you look at dogs, and show them your appreciation & love with "like" and "pat" buttons. Or even better, create a profile for your beloved doggo on Wander for others to send your doggo some love! ❤️

The aim of this service is to enable dog lovers to stare and appreciate dogs, and for dog owners to show off their beloved dog and validate how cool their dog is.

## Status

The base features have been completed. I plan to rewrite this from the ground up using modern tech to develop cooler features and smoother UX. Stay tuned!
💡 The main idea I will be looking into in the next build is matching dog owners with other dog owners, as well as those wanting to provide services such as dog walkers/groomers/sitters 🐶
